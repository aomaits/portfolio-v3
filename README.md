## Description
This project was started to deal with a simple problem: my [old HTML & CSS portfolio](https://aomaits.github.io/portfolio-1/) badly needed an update. 

With this [version 3 portfolio](https://www.abeomaits.com/), I was able to put together something that looks more professional and showcases my work. By making a few key personalizations but basing the majority of the project on the Free Code Camp Tutorial, I was able to get this portfolio up and running swiftly. This project also introduced me to SvelteKit and granted me more expore to TailwindCSS. 

### Challenge Overcome
The biggest challenge of the project came from not understanding how to incorporate the links to my projects. I hadn't worked with Svelte at all prior to this, so I didn't understand how certain components might be utilized. In the end, I was able to determine where and how to assign the necessary links and gained a better comprehension of the way that the Step.svelte component is being rendered in this project. 

## Installation

## Credits
The obvious and most important credit here is the [portfolio tutorial from Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-sveltekit-and-tailwind-css-by-building-a-web-portfolio/) that was used to create this project. A big thanks to James McArthur, aka Smoljames, for the clear walkthrough code-along! 

Within that project, they utilized the [particle.js background created by Vincent Garreau](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/). Thanks Vincent!
